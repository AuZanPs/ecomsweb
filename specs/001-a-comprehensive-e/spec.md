# Feature Specification: Comprehensive E-Commerce Platform Core Feature Set

**Feature Branch**: `001-a-comprehensive-e`  
**Created**: 2025-09-16  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "A comprehensive e-commerce website with user authentication, product catalog, shopping cart, and payment processing."

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
	‚Üí If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
	‚Üí Identify: actors (customer, admin), actions (authenticate, browse, search, add to cart, checkout, pay), data (users, products, carts, orders, payments), constraints (secure handling, correctness)
3. For each unclear aspect:
	‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
	‚Üí If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
	‚Üí Each requirement must be testable
	‚Üí Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (data clearly implied)
7. Run Review Checklist
	‚Üí If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
	‚Üí If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., returns policy) mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
	- User types and permissions
	- Data retention/deletion policies  
	- Performance targets and scale
	- Error handling behaviors
	- Integration requirements
	- Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
A visitor registers or signs in, browses the product catalog, searches for an item, views product details, adds items to a shopping cart, reviews the cart, proceeds to checkout, provides required order information, initiates a secure payment, and upon successful payment the order is recorded for later tracking.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a registered user is authenticated, **When** they search for a product by keyword, **Then** the system returns a list of matching products ordered in a predictable manner (e.g., relevance or recency) and **And** shows an empty result state if none match.
2. **Given** a user has items in their cart, **When** they initiate checkout with all required information provided, **Then** the system validates availability, computes totals, and initiates a payment session.
3. **Given** a payment is confirmed, **When** confirmation is received, **Then** the order status becomes Paid and is available in the user‚Äôs order history.
4. **Given** a product becomes unavailable before payment, **When** the user attempts checkout, **Then** the system prevents completion and indicates which item(s) are unavailable.
5. **Given** an unauthenticated visitor attempts to view a personal cart, **When** they call a protected function, **Then** they are prompted to authenticate.

### Edge Cases
- Empty cart at checkout attempt: System blocks checkout and communicates that at least one item is required.
- Payment failure: Cart remains unchanged and available for immediate retry after user addresses failure reason (e.g., insufficient funds, cancellation).
- Product stock changes between add and checkout: System re‚Äëvalidates; if any item exceeds remaining stock it adjusts quantity down to maximum available and informs user before proceeding.
- Partial fulfillment policy: System does NOT allow automatic partial orders; user must explicitly adjust cart until all items are valid (prevents unintended split shipments in MVP).
- Session/token expiration during checkout: User is prompted to re‚Äëauthenticate; cart state and entered checkout form data (excluding sensitive payment info) are preserved for one retry attempt.

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST allow users to create an account with minimally a unique email, display name, and password.
- **FR-002**: System MUST validate uniqueness of email during registration and reject duplicates with a clear error message.
- **FR-003**: System MUST allow users to authenticate using their registered credentials.
- **FR-004**: System MUST restrict access to personal cart and order history to authenticated users only.
- **FR-005**: System MUST allow authenticated users to browse a catalog of products.
- **FR-006**: System MUST allow keyword search over product names (case-insensitive).
- **FR-007**: System MUST present product details including name, description, price, primary image reference, and stock availability indicator.
- **FR-008**: System MUST allow authenticated users to add a product to their shopping cart with a specified quantity defaulting to one.
- **FR-009**: System MUST prevent adding quantities exceeding available stock at the time of the add/update action.
- **FR-010**: System MUST allow users to update cart line item quantities or remove items entirely.
- **FR-011**: System MUST compute and present per-line subtotal and overall cart subtotal based on stored authoritative pricing.
- **FR-012**: System MUST block checkout if the cart is empty.
- **FR-013**: System MUST re‚Äëvalidate product availability for all cart items at the start of checkout.
- **FR-014**: System MUST collect required order submission information: full name, street address line 1, optional address line 2, city, state/region (if applicable), postal code, country, and contact email.
- **FR-015**: System MUST compute an order total = sum(line item unit price * quantity) + flat shipping fee (assumed 0 in MVP) + flat tax (assumed 0 in MVP) for simplicity.
- **FR-016**: System MUST initiate a payment process for the calculated total via an external payment service.
- **FR-017**: System MUST consider an order pending until payment confirmation is received.
- **FR-018**: System MUST record a successful payment and mark the order as paid.
- **FR-019**: System MUST retain cart contents if payment fails to allow user to retry.
- **FR-020**: System MUST provide users access to a list of their past orders with summary information (order identifier, date placed, total, status).
- **FR-021**: System MUST allow users to view detailed order information including line items and current status.
- **FR-022**: System MUST indicate a clear failure state when payment is declined or aborted.
- **FR-023**: System MUST prevent unauthorized users from accessing or modifying another user‚Äôs cart or orders.
- **FR-024**: System MUST maintain order status lifecycle: Payment Pending ‚Üí Paid ‚Üí (future statuses deferred; MVP ends at Paid). Cancellation path: Payment Pending ‚Üí Cancelled (user abort) or Paid ‚Üí Cancelled (manual intervention) ‚Äî cancellations after Paid are recorded with timestamp.
- **FR-025**: System MUST handle search requests returning zero products gracefully (no error, clear empty state).
- **FR-026**: System MUST order product listings by newest first (creation timestamp descending) by default.
- **FR-027**: System MUST ensure pricing displayed in cart and at checkout is consistent (single authoritative price source).
- **FR-028**: System MUST allow user sign-out by removing authentication token client side; server relies on token expiration and signature validation (stateless sessions).
- **FR-029**: System MUST adjust cart line item quantity downward to available stock if reduced since addition and inform user prior to checkout confirmation.
- **FR-030**: System MUST block checkout if any adjusted quantity becomes zero after re-validation until user removes or updates affected items.
- **FR-031**: System MUST retain last failed payment attempt reference with reason string for user feedback.
- **FR-032**: System MUST allow retry of payment without creating duplicate order records while status = Payment Pending.
- **FR-033**: System MUST prevent transition from Paid to Payment Pending (no regression of status).
- **FR-034**: System MUST record timestamp for each status transition for audit trail (at minimum created, paid, cancelled if applicable).

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **User**: Represents a registered individual; attributes include identifier, unique email, display name, credentials (secured), and association to carts and orders.
- **Product**: Represents an item available for browsing and purchase; attributes include identifier, name, description, price, primary image reference, and stock indicator.
- **Cart**: Represents a user‚Äôs current intended purchases; contains line items each referencing a product, quantity, and derived subtotal.
- **Order**: Represents a confirmed purchase attempt linked to a user, containing items snapshot (product reference + quantity + unit price at time of order), totals, and status.
- **Payment Session**: Represents an external payment attempt correlated with an order total and its confirmation or failure outcome.
